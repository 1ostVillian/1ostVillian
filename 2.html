    <h1>Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
        I see my future in your eyes</h1>


        <h2>Girl, you know I want your love
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            I may be crazy, don't mind me
            Say, boy, let's not talk too much
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            Come, come on now, follow my lead</h2>
            

            <h3>When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh)
                You're the reason I believe in love
                It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh)
                And I'm afraid that I'ma f- it up
                Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
                'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
                And you know that I know that I can't live without you
                So, baby, stay</h3>
